### 10 Levels
**Required tech:** [Instance Duplication](https://github.com/yujene/bloxorzguide#instance-duplication-and-stacking)

This category's routing currently does stages 1-7, and 10 using glitchless strats. On stage 8, we can skip to stage 10.

On stage 8, stack once then complete the stage with glitchless strats to warp to stage 10. This [video](https://youtu.be/Yj86HAkrAbU?t=78) shows the skip.

### 20 Levels
**Required tech:** [Instance Duplication](https://github.com/yujene/bloxorzguide#instance-duplication-and-stacking), [Desync Stacking](https://github.com/yujene/bloxorzguide#desync-stacking)

This category's routing currently does stages 1-7, and 20 using glitchless strats. On stage 8, we can skip to stage 20.

To skip from stage 8 to 20, we need 12 instances. Since 12 = 2x2x2x1.5, we need to use desync stacking. In this [video](https://youtu.be/G4DKBixYwkU?t=79), 12 instances are made by stacking 3 times then desync stacking once. However, the earlier we desync stack, the less instances we will have during the stacking process. Having less instances while stacking should decrease time lost to lag from high instance counts. The table below shows the number of instances during the stacking process depending on when desync stacking is done. This is indicated by the order of the multiplication in the first column. 2 indicates a normal stack and 1.5 indicates desync stack.

|Stack Order|Number of Instances|
|-----|-----|
|2 x 2 x 2 x 1.5|1, 2, 4, 8, 12|
|2 x 2 x 1.5 x 2|1, 2, 4, 6, 12|
|2 x 1.5 x 2 x 2|1, 2, 3, 6, 12|

Since desync stacking requires 2 instances, the earliest and best order is stack once, desync stack once, stack twice. After stacking up to 12 instances, complete stage 8 to warp to 20.

### 33 Levels
**Required tech:** [Instance Duplication](https://github.com/yujene/bloxorzguide#instance-duplication-and-stacking), [Menuing](https://github.com/yujene/bloxorzguide#menuing)

This category's routing currently does stages 1-7, and 33 using glitchless strats. On stage 8, we can skip to stage 33.

On stage 8, stack 5 times to get 32 instances. To be able to skip to 33, we need the levelNumber to become 1 since 1+32=33. This requires pressing Quit to Menu to set the levelNumber to 1 while reloading the stage. The two known ways to reload the stage for this skip are dying or completing the stage.

Fast method: with 32 instances, do the chained fast toggled glitchless stage 8 strat to complete the stage. Doing this optimally should be a bit easier since the game should be very laggy with 5 stacks. As you complete the stage, press Quit to Menu. This sets the levelNumber to 1 as the game tries to load the next stage and warps you to 33. This [video](https://youtu.be/nD28sogw0K4?t=78) shows this method with unoptimal stage 8 strat but shows the skip.

Slower method: with 32 instances, fall off stage 8 and Quit to Menu. This sets the levelNumber to 1, and dying reloads the stage. You'll respawn on stage 1 with 32 instances. Complete stage 1 and warp to 33. This [video](https://youtu.be/Bl1jaWTkQ5E?t=78) shows the skip with this method.
