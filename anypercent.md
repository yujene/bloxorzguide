### 10 Levels
This category's routing currently does stages 1-7, and 10 using glitchless strats.

**The Skip:** On stage 8, we need to stack once to skip to stage 10.

**Video Description:** Move right until the block is split. Fast split, then fast toggle until both cubes are on the edge. Kill both cubes to get a stack of instance duplication.

**Notes:** Before moving after respawning, ensure both instances are synced by listening for both blocks to land. After syncing both instances, solve stage 8 using glitchless strats.

### 20 Levels
This category's routing currently does stages 1-7, and 20 using glitchless strats. From stage 8, we can skip to stage 20.

----
### 33 Levels
This category's routing currently does stages 1-7, and 33 using glitchless strats.

**The Skip:** On stage 8, we need to stack five times, QTM while dying, then complete stage 1 to skip to stage 33.

**Video Description:** Video starts on the fifth stack, and the game slows significantly at this point since there's 32 instances. Once the blocks from all instances have audibly dropped, press left and quit to menu. Solve stage 1 using glitchless strats.

**Notes:** Stacking five times skips 32 stages because 2^5=32. We QTM and die to set the level number to 1, which allows us to add 32 to skip to 33. If you only QTM without dying, you skip to stage 32, and I have no clue why.
